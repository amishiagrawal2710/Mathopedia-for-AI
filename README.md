# Mathopedia-for-AI

The goal of this organization is to reach those keen to explore the world of AI and help them to gain a better understanding of how math intertwines with artificial intelligence.

The boundaries of Artificial Intelligence extend to infinity and beyond. And mathematics is, arguably, one of the best ways to explore the sound foundation that AI stands on. In this channel, we will explore some of the basic concepts of algebra, probability, complex numbers, vectors and matrices to assemble a foundation for AI and ML.

Learning the preliminary math for AI also allows us to look at some intricate connections between the two fields with exposure to new relevant skills such as computer programming, logic, and mathematical computation.
